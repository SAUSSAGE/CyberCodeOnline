		"TRASH": [
			"A broken and battered ${itemName} barely held together by weak glue & strips of duct tape. True to its ${tierName} designation, it barely functions as a ${itemType}.",
			"It used to be the peak technology of its time, with very low mass manufacturing costs ${itemName} its reputation and quality. Nothing more than a ${tierName} of its fate.",
			"Nothing more than an abandoned artefact. Although, 'artefact' seems to imply some degree of significance. It could be less of an artefact than just detritus. Then again, these ${itemType} were only as 'functional' as they needed to be.",
			"It's a wonder this ${itemType} even still has most of its pieces.",
			"Whatever dumpster this ${itemType} came from almost certainly contained spoiled food that'd be worth more than the ${itemName} itself.",
			"One might examine ${itemName}, hoping to find something valuable. Alas, they would have wasted their valuable time.",
			"This ${itemType} was recalled by the manufacturer for known bad defects. It might be way more useful as scrap material.",
			"Rough edges do make a ${itemType} lose its value exponentially, to the point where calling its 'name' makes a merchant ignore its existence.",
			"Having such a remarkable brand doesn't mean that a ${itemType} gear like this one will live up to its name. Living up to its ${tierName} tier that is.",
			"If time is money, the few seconds it takes you to read this are worth well more than the ${itemName} you see before you.",
			"In most cases, handcrafted gear will most likely destroy its owner while trying to be as functional as possible. Do hope that this ${itemType} gear doesn't come with flatline bills.",
			"Weathered and beaten, this ${itemName} has seen better days.  Unfortunately, better days are relative.  It was shoddily made, to begin with as well.",
			"The design of ${itemName} leaves one guessing if the creator of ${itemName} had a plan for it or if ${itemName} was a total mistake"

		"BASURA":
			"Un ${itemName} roto y maltratado apenas se mantiene unido con pegamento débil y tiras de cinta adhesiva. Fiel a su designación ${tierName}, apenas funciona como un ${itemType}.",
			"Solía ​​ser la tecnología punta de su tiempo, con costos de fabricación en masa muy bajos ${itemName} su reputación y calidad. Nada más que ${tierName} de su destino.",
			"Nada más que un artefacto abandonado. Aunque, 'artefacto' parece implicar cierto grado de importancia. Podría ser menos un artefacto que solo detritos. Por otra parte, estos ${itemType} eran tan 'funcionales' como necesitaban ser.",
			"Es una maravilla que este ${itemType} aún tenga la mayoría de sus piezas.",
			"Cualquiera que sea el contenedor de basura del que vino este ${itemType} casi seguramente contenía comida en mal estado que valdría más que el propio ${itemName}.",
			"Uno podría examinar ${itemName} con la esperanza de encontrar algo valioso. Lamentablemente, habrían perdido su valioso tiempo.",
			"El fabricante retiró este ${itemType} por defectos conocidos. Podría ser mucho más útil como material de desecho.",
			"Las asperezas hacen que un ${itemType} pierda su valor exponencialmente, hasta el punto de que llamar su 'nombre' hace que un comerciante ignore su existencia.",
			"Tener una marca tan notable no significa que un equipo ${itemType} como este estará a la altura de su nombre. Está a la altura de su nivel ${tierName}.",
			"Si el tiempo es oro, los pocos segundos que te lleva leer esto valen mucho más que los ${itemName} que ves delante de ti.",
			"En la mayoría de los casos, el equipo hecho a mano probablemente destruirá a su propietario mientras intenta ser lo más funcional posible. Espero que este equipo ${itemType} no venga con billetes planos.",
			"Desgastado y golpeado, este ${itemName} ha tenido mejores días. Desafortunadamente, los mejores días son relativos. Para empezar, también fue hecho de mala calidad.",
			"El diseño de ${itemName} deja a uno con la duda de si el creador de ${itemName} tenía un plan para ello o si ${itemName} fue un error total"
